# sudoku-solver
This is a simple sudoku solver implementation.

Given a list of lists, whose elements are numbers 0..9, where 0 stands for unknown, 
it generates all possible solutions of a sudoku puzzle in readable form. If there is no solutions
a respective message is printed.

## Plans
Make a OCR input for a puzzle. At first for printed ones, not handwritten.
